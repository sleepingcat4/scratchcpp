// A computerâ€™s memory can be thought of as an array of bytes.
// we will use the address-of operator & before the identifier to access the address of the variable.
// The address-of operator (&) is a unary operator. It is used to extract the memory address of the variable.

  cout << "John Address = " << &John << endl;
