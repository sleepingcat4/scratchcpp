/*
there are three types of operators:
1. Unary
2. Binary
3. Ternary

The compound assignment operator is used to perform an operation and then assign the result to the operand on the left-hand side.
// Right-shifting an operand1 >> operand2 is equivalent to dividing operand1 by 2operand2
Left-shifting an operand1 << operand2 is equivalent to multiplying operand1 by 2operand2
The tilde operator is a bitwise complement operator that inverts all the bits in a number.
